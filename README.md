# Challenge 4: Timed Coding Quiz

## Description
This week's challenge was to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions.

The acceptance criteria is as follows:
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

To complete this project, I put into practice my knowledge of advanced JavaScript and Web API's.
